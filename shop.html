        <h1>App Development</h1>
        <p>
          Application developers write software programs for use across mobile
          operating systems, including Apple, Android, and Windows devices. Once
          applications are created, application developers are also responsible
          for testing the application and providing updates whenever necessary.
          <br />
          <br />

          The easy answer is: App developers create mobile and computer apps and
          software programmers create, test programs or systems and fix bugs if
          and when they encounter them.
